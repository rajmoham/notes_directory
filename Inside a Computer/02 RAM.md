# Introduction
- RAM voltage determines the speed 
- RAM speed is the number of cycles per second at which data is transferred.
- RAM bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred between the processor and the RAM.
- Certain motherboards will only support certain DDR versions.
- CPU speeds and demands impacts the requirement for DDR versions.
# Formats
## DDR1
DDR = Double data rate
- 2.5 volts
- 184 pins for desktops and 200 for laptops
- Physically has a notch in the centre
## DDR2
- Was technically meant to be faster and use less power than DDR1
- However, it had higher latency. Although more data could be moved, the amount of taken to start moving took longer.
- 1.8 volts
- 240 pins
- Notch slightly off centre
# DDR3
- 1.5 volts (1.3v for low-power version)
- 240 pins
- Notch slightly off centre (opposite direction to DDR2)
- 8n prefetch buffer -> Fly-By Topology
# DDR4
- 1.2 volts
- 288 pins
- Significantly higher speeds (which upcoming processors required, hence popularity grew overtime)
- Bank groups -> allowed memory process tasks in parallel
- Better Cyclic Redundancy Checks for stability
## DDR5
- 1.1 volts
- 288 pins
- Much higher speeds and bandwidths
- Introduced dual sub-channels -> can handle multiple data streams simultaneously 
- ON_DIE ECC -> used for real-time error checking and power management
- Most useful for video editing and 3D rendering (gaming shows minimal improvement)
